# React Google Sheets API

Hello there,
I have found a linkedIn post of freeCodeCamp about this API.
There was a complete guide to make this API with class component.

I practised and made this with fucntional component and its working properly.

You can check it here

While Practising I have realized that it's very easy to do CURD operation with Google Sheets and anyone can read the docs and make the API.

I have implemented the POST methode. For further need I will implement the other methodes.

# Thank You
